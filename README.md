Projects Included:
1. GettingOverIt: GettingOverIt is a wellness-focused application designed to support users in overcoming nicotine addiction and breaking bad habits. It provides essential information, resources, and interactive tools to help users stay accountable. Key features include a personalized daily journal and a sobriety day counter, both tailored to the logged-in user to track individual progress over time.
2. CalculusProject: This terminal-based application assists users in solving mathematical series. Users input a function representing a series, and the program processes and displays the result directly in the terminal, offering a straightforward tool for exploring calculus concepts.
3.ComputerSystemsProject: A process scheduling simulator that calculates turnaround time (Tr) and service time (Ts) based on user input. Users enter the number of processes, their respective execution times, and a time quantum for Round Robin scheduling. The application then computes and displays the performance metrics, making it a useful tool for visualizing CPU scheduling behavior.
